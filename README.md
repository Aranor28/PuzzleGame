# PuzzleGame

By Adrian Amigues and Ana√Øs Cannac

## Description

* The game offers 3 different puzzles with each 3 different difficulty levels. 
* Shaking the device during a puzzle solving will show you the solution, shaking it again will go back to the solving.
* It tracks the progression of finished puzzles for each difficulty.

## Room for improvement

The code makes its very easy to add puzzles and difficulty levels. It would not be hard to allow the use of any user picture.
